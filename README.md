I have made a Static website by using the front end languages(HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT) and then deployed it by using "AZURE STATIC WEB APPS".

After deploying I have used Azure Blob Storage to upload all the content of the website to my Storage Account in Azure Portal Azure Blob storage is a feature of Microsoft Azure. It allows users to store large amounts of unstructured data on Microsoft's data storage platform.
